    Glossary terms need a term, slug, and definition attribute. 
    The term attribute will appear above the definition.
    The slug is a unique identifier for the term.
    It should be lowercase, with no special characters or punctuation, and any spaces replaced with a dash.
- term: Yet another term
  slug: yet-another-term

    Want to link to a specific glossary term in your text, like [this one here](#glossary){:.term #yet-another-term}?
    You will need to edit your markdown like so: 

        [this one here](#glossary){:.term #yet-another-term}

    Just swap in the right slug after the # sign.
