## Introduction

The template is derived from [CFPB/DOCter](https://github.com/CFPB/DOCter) and [18F/guides-template](https://github.com/18F/guides-template). It uses [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) as the rendering engine.

DCgov guides sites are intended for documenting **best practice standards** (e.g. design, accessibility, analytics, licensing). They may also be used to provide **background information** on project repositories, but you really should try to do so in your repository's README file. [18F's open source style guide](https://pages.18f.gov/open-source-guide/) provides excellent advice for making your projects easy to use and understand!

## Create a new guide

To get started on a new guide, follow [the "Getting started" instructions in the DCgov/guides-template GitHub repository](https://github.com/DCgov/guides-template/#getting-started) to create a local clone of this template.

Once you've created a clone, click the _Add a New Page_ entry in the table of
contents to begin the rest of the steps.
